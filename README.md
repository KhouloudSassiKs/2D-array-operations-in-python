# 2D-array-operations-in-python ðŸ“š
This repository contains Python implementations of **matrix traversal algorithms** for 2D arrays.  
It includes different ways to iterate over matrices, inspired by bookshelf-style layouts.  

**Note:** This is my independent work, developed based on practice exercises from CodeSignal.
## Algorithms Included

1. **Zig-Zag Column-wise Traversal**  
   - **File:** `column-zigzag.py`  
   - Traverses a matrix column by column in a zig-zag pattern, starting from the bottom-right corner.

2. **Vertical Column Traversal**  
   - **File:** `vertical-traversal.py`  
   - Traverses a matrix column by column from bottom to top, moving from the rightmost column to the leftmost.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matrix-traversals.git
